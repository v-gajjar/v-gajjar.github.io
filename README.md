# Welcome to my personal portfolio website repo!

![Preview of the current design dradt](https://github.com/v-gajjar/v-gajjar.github.io/blob/main/Portfolio_Preview.gif)

I haven't yet started building the actual site, as I'm still in the drafting phase — but here's what I'm thinking so far:

## Design

- I'll be using a **bright, bold shade of green** as the primary color — it feels very *me*, and I find it both calming and empowering.
- I'll pair it with **light cream/off-white** and **olive green**.
- I'll use a dark gray colour for majority of the text, so it's easier on the eyes!
- I'm thinking of including **fern leaf patterns** into the design somewhere. 
- These color and design choices are inspired by **Scandinavian design**,
- I love the light, airy and minimal feel of many Scandivanian inspred coffee shops, and their shelves that have green plants!

## Tech Stack

- Not yet finalised, but highly likely to be using **Astro**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**
- I’m thinking of using **Canva** or **Figma** to help with prototyping the design

## Building in Public

As with my other projects, I’ll be **building in public on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinaygajjar/)** — so keep an eye out for updates!

*(I’ve already posted about the color scheme!)*
