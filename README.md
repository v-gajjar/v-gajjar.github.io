# Welcome to my personal portfolio website repo!

I haven't yet started building the actual site, as I'm still in the drafting phase — but here's what I'm thinking so far:

## Design

- I'll be using a **bright, bold shade of green** as the primary color — it feels very *me*, and I find it both calming and empowering.
- I'll pair it with **light cream/off-white** and **olive green**.
- I may scatter **fern leaf patterns** throughout the page for a natural vibe.
- These color and design choices are inspired by **Scandinavian design**.

## Tech Stack

- Not yet finalised, but highly likely to be using **Astro**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**
- I’m thinking of using **Canva** or **Figma** to help with prototyping the design

## Building in Public

As with my other projects, I’ll be **building in public on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinaygajjar/)** — so keep an eye out for updates!

*(I’ve already posted about the color scheme!)*
